# Making Snake, Learning Rust

I'm just learning Rust and found this great video [Making a Snake Game in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCwMb0KslX8).

# Run Game
Assuming you have [rust installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)...

In a terminal...

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Enjoy!**

_or don't. Whatever._
